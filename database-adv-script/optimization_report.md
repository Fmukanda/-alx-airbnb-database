# Query Performance Analysis
This document outlines the analysis and optimization of a complex query that retrieves **bookings** along with related **user, property, and payment details**.
## 1. Initial Query
This initial query is designed to demonstrate performance analysis. It retrieves all bookings along with extensive details from related tables. This query may be inefficient on a large dataset due to multiple joins.
