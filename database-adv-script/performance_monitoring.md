# Query Performance Monitoring and Optimization
This document describes how to monitor query performance, identify bottlenecks, and apply optimizations to improve efficiency.

## Frequently Used Queries for Monitoring
```sql
-- Query 1: User bookings with details (Dashboard view)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) as total_bookings,
    SUM(b.total_price) as total_spent,
    MAX(b.created_at) as last_booking_date
FROM "user" u
LEFT JOIN booking b ON u.user_id = b.user_id
WHERE u.role = 'guest'
GROUP BY u.user_id
HAVING COUNT(b.booking_id) > 0
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- Query 2: Property availability and bookings (Search functionality)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name,
    p.location,
    p.pricepernight,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) as total_bookings,
    AVG(r.rating) as average_rating,
    COUNT(r.review_id) as review_count
FROM property p
LEFT JOIN booking b ON p.property_id = b.property_id
LEFT JOIN review r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
WHERE p.location ILIKE '%beach%'
AND p.pricepernight BETWEEN 50 AND 300
GROUP BY p.property_id
HAVING AVG(r.rating) >= 4.0
ORDER BY average_rating DESC, total_bookings DESC;

-- Query 3: Date range bookings report (Reporting)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', b.start_date) as booking_month,
    p.location,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) as total_bookings,
    SUM(b.total_price) as total_revenue,
    AVG(b.total_price) as avg_booking_value,
    COUNT(DISTINCT b.user_id) as unique_guests
FROM booking b
INNER JOIN property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
WHERE b.start_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
AND b.status = 'confirmed'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', b.start_date), p.location
ORDER BY booking_month DESC, total_revenue DESC;

-- Query 4: User activity timeline (User profile)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    p.name as property_name,
    p.location,
    r.rating,
    r.comment
FROM "user" u
LEFT JOIN booking b ON u.user_id = b.user_id
LEFT JOIN property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN review r ON b.booking_id = r.booking_id
WHERE u.user_id = 'some-user-uuid-here'
ORDER BY b.start_date DESC;

-- Query 5: Host performance dashboard (Host view)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    host.user_id as host_id,
    host.first_name,
    host.last_name,
    COUNT(p.property_id) as total_properties,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) as total_bookings,
    SUM(b.total_price) as total_revenue,
    AVG(r.rating) as average_rating,
    COUNT(r.review_id) as total_reviews
FROM "user" host
LEFT JOIN property p ON host.user_id = p.host_id
LEFT JOIN booking b ON p.property_id = b.property_id
LEFT JOIN review r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
WHERE host.role = 'host'
```
## 2. Bottleneck Analysis Report
**Query 1: User Bookings Dashboard**
 - Bottleneck: Sequential scan on booking table for LEFT JOIN
 - Issue: No index on booking.user_id for aggregation
 - Solution: Create composite index on (user_id, created_at)

**Query 2: Property Search**
 - Bottleneck: Multiple LEFT JOINs without proper indexes
 - Issue: No indexes on review.property_id and ILIKE search on location
 - Solution: Add full-text search index on location and review indexes

**Query 3: Date Range Report**
 - Bottleneck: Full table scan on booking table
 - Issue: No partition pruning or date range indexes
 - Solution: Implement range partitioning or partial indexes

**Query 4: User Activity**
 - Bottleneck: Multiple LEFT JOINs for single user
 - Issue: No covering indexes for user activity queries
 - Solution: Create targeted indexes for user-centric queries

**Query 5: Host Dashboard**
 - Bottleneck: Multiple aggregations across large tables
 - Issue: No materialized view for host metrics
 - Solution: Create summary table for host performance
GROUP BY host.user_id
HAVING COUNT(b.booking_id) > 0
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

## 3. Recommended Indexes and Schema Changes
```sql
-- Recommended indexes and schema adjustments

-- 1. Indexes for Query 1 (User bookings)
CREATE INDEX idx_user_bookings_aggregation ON booking(user_id, created_at, total_price);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_role ON "user"(role) WHERE role = 'guest';

-- 2. Indexes for Query 2 (Property search)
CREATE INDEX idx_property_search ON property USING gin(location gin_trgm_ops);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_price_location ON property(pricepernight, location);
CREATE INDEX idx_review_property_rating ON review(property_id, rating);

-- 3. Indexes for Query 3 (Date range reports)
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_date_range ON booking(start_date, status, property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_monthly_reports ON booking(
    DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date), 
    status, 
    total_price
);

-- 4. Indexes for Query 4 (User activity)
CREATE INDEX idx_user_activity ON booking(user_id, start_date DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_property ON booking(property_id, user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_review_booking ON review(booking_id, rating);

-- 5. Indexes for Query 5 (Host dashboard)
CREATE INDEX idx_host_properties ON property(host_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_host_performance ON property(host_id, property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_host_performance ON booking(property_id, status, total_price);

-- 6. Materialized view for host performance (refresh periodically)
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW host_performance_summary AS
SELECT 
    host.user_id as host_id,
    host.first_name,
    host.last_name,
    COUNT(p.property_id) as total_properties,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) as total_bookings,
    SUM(b.total_price) as total_revenue,
    AVG(r.rating) as average_rating,
    COUNT(r.review_id) as total_reviews,
    MAX(b.created_at) as last_booking_date
FROM "user" host
LEFT JOIN property p ON host.user_id = p.host_id
LEFT JOIN booking b ON p.property_id = b.property_id
LEFT JOIN review r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
WHERE host.role = 'host'
GROUP BY host.user_id;

CREATE INDEX idx_host_summary ON host_performance_summary(host_id);

-- 7. Add covering indexes for common report queries
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_covering ON booking(
    start_date, 
    status, 
    total_price, 
    user_id, 
    property_id
);

-- 8. Enable full-text search for better location searches
ALTER TABLE property ADD COLUMN search_vector tsvector;
UPDATE property SET search_vector = to_tsvector('english', location || ' ' || name || ' ' || description);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_search_vector ON property USING gin(search_vector);
```
